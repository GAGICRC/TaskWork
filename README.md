# TaskWork
Nowadays, there are many ways one can make money by completing various kinds of tasks, such as: plumbing, cable customer support and even bigger ones like Outsourcing. With the advance in economy over the years, the simple task trading system, without any payment method, is becoming unused, because the need to have money for anything is a reality, which means that, for any service you may need, there’s a need to pay for it. Our goal is to bring back those old habits, with a simple Android app developed using the Native Architecture of the Android device and with a cloud-based database and server, without taking out the modern part of the deal, which is the possibility to still get payed to do a task.
